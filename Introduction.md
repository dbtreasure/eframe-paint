# Introduction

Welcome to our project—a modern, cross-platform digital painting application built with Rust. This application harnesses the power of immediate mode GUI libraries, such as @egui, along with frameworks like @eframe, to deliver a fluid, interactive, and high-performance drawing experience.

Throughout its evolution, our application has been documented in a series of chapters that capture both the technical challenges and creative breakthroughs that have shaped its development. Each chapter delves into different aspects of the journey:

- **Chapter 1:** The inception of our app, laying the foundational setup and key architectural decisions.
- **Chapter 2:** Evolving configuration and build enhancements, highlighting improvements in robustness and maintainability.
- **Chapter 3:** Integrating graphics and immediate mode UI to bring the canvas to life.
- **Chapter 4:** A deep dive into the application pipeline—from startup to rendering user strokes.
- **Chapter 5:** Tools of the trade, featuring advanced drawing interactions and comprehensive layer management.
- **Chapter 6:** Introducing a command system for undoing mistakes, with document refactoring for better state management.
- **Chapter 7:** Polishing command management and enhancing the undo/redo system for a smoother user experience.
- **Chapter 8:** Accelerating rendering performance and adding dynamic visual effects to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Chapter 9:** Advancing input handling with multi-touch support and gesture recognition for an intuitive drawing process.
- **Chapter 10:** Real-time collaboration and cloud synchronization to enable collaborative creativity across devices.

These chapters serve not only as a technical log of our journey but also as an invitation to explore and understand the design, code, and creative decisions that power our application. As we look to the future, there is ample room for further innovations—whether through integrating more advanced AI-assisted drawing tools, improving collaborative features, or expanding our platform support.

We invite you to explore these chapters, learn from our experiences, and join us as we continue to push the boundaries of digital art and real-time collaboration.

Welcome to the future of digital creativity!
