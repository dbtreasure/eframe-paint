# Introduction

Welcome to our project—a modern, cross-platform digital painting application built with Rust. This application harnesses the power of immediate mode GUI libraries, such as @egui, along with frameworks like @eframe, to deliver a fluid, interactive, and high-performance drawing experience.

Throughout its evolution, our application has been documented in a series of chapters that capture both the technical challenges and creative breakthroughs that have shaped its development. Each chapter delves into different aspects of the journey:

- **Chapter 1:** [The Inception of Our App – Laying the foundation and key architectural decisions.](Chapter_1.md)
- **Chapter 2:** [Evolving Configuration and Build Enhancements – Improving robustness and maintainability.](Chapter_2.md)
- **Chapter 3:** [Interactive Canvas Design – Integrating graphics and immediate mode UI to bring the canvas to life.](Chapter_3.md)
- **Chapter 4:** [Rendering Pipeline and Input Handling – A deep dive into the application pipeline from startup to stroke rendering.](Chapter_4.md)
- **Chapter 5:** [Advanced Drawing Tools – Enhanced drawing interactions and comprehensive layer management.](Chapter_5.md)
- **Chapter 6:** [Command System and Document Refactoring – Empowering undo/redo and robust state management.](Chapter_6.md)
- **Chapter 7:** [Polished Command Management – Enhancing undo/redo and editing history for a smoother user experience.](Chapter_7.md)
- **Chapter 8:** [Performance and Visual Effects – Accelerating rendering and adding dynamic visual effects.](Chapter_8.md)
- **Chapter 9:** [Revamping Layer Management – Reordering and renaming enhancements for intuitive control.](Chapter_9.md)
- **Chapter 10:** [Coordinated Stroke Rendering – Converting between screen and document spaces for precision input.](Chapter_10.md)

These chapters serve not only as a technical log of our journey but also as an invitation to explore and understand the design, code, and creative decisions that power our application. As we look to the future, there is ample room for further innovations—whether through integrating more advanced AI-assisted drawing tools, improving collaborative features, or expanding our platform support.

We invite you to explore these chapters, learn from our experiences, and join us as we continue to push the boundaries of digital art and real-time collaboration.

Welcome to the future of digital creativity!
