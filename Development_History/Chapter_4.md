# Chapter 4: From Startup to Stroke – Understanding the Application Pipeline

In this chapter, we will walk through the complete journey of our paint application—from the moment the app starts up until a user's stroke is rendered on the screen. Our goal is to illuminate the pipeline that connects initialization, event processing, stroke capturing, and finally, rendering. If you are new to Rust, graphics programming, or immediate mode GUIs, this chapter will help you understand how these parts come together in a linear, step-by-step fashion.

## Overview

_What we're going to cover:_

1. **Application Startup:** How the app initializes and sets up the environment.
2. **Input Event Processing:** Capturing user interactions to create a stroke.
3. **Stroke Data Processing:** How the stroke data is stored and processed.
4. **Rendering the Stroke:** How the renderer takes this data and draws it onto the screen.

After explaining each stage, we will summarize what was learned.

---

## 1. Application Startup

At startup, our application calls the `new` method of our main app structure (here, `PaintApp`). This method is responsible for initializing the necessary components—most notably, the Renderer, which sets up GPU-based drawing.

Here's a simplified version of the initialization:

```rust
// A simple example to illustrate initializing a component in Rust
struct SimpleApp {
    initialized: bool,
}

impl SimpleApp {
    fn new() -> Self {
        // In Rust, we create a new instance using a constructor
        Self { initialized: true }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let app = SimpleApp::new();
    assert!(app.initialized);
    println!("Application started: {}", app.initialized);
}
```

In our paint application, the process is similar but more complex. The `PaintApp::new` method initializes the Renderer by obtaining the OpenGL context from the creation context. This ensures our app is ready to perform GPU-based rendering from the very start.

---

## 2. Capturing User Input: Creating a Stroke

Once the app is running, the next stage is handling user input. In an immediate mode GUI, the UI is re-created every frame. In our `update` method, we use input events (like mouse drags) to capture stroke information.

Imagine you want to record a series of points as the user drags the mouse. A simplified Rust example might look like this:

```rust
// Define a stroke as a vector of points (tuples for x and y coordinates)
type Point = (f32, f32);

fn capture_stroke(drag_events: Vec<Point>) -> Vec<Point> {
    // For simplicity, just return the events as the stroke
    drag_events
}

fn main() {
    let simulated_drag = vec![(10.0, 20.0), (15.0, 25.0), (20.0, 30.0)];
    let stroke = capture_stroke(simulated_drag);
    println!("Captured stroke: {:?}", stroke);
}
```

In our application, the update loop allocates a painter area and senses drag events. These events are used to decide where and how to draw a stroke. Behind the scenes, the code tracks the drag state and stores the stroke points temporarily until rendering.

---

## 3. Processing and Rendering the Stroke

Now that the stroke data is captured, the next step is to render these points. The Renderer module takes over here. It uses the painter obtained from @egui to draw the stroke on a designated canvas area.

The render method in our Renderer module is designed to be as simple as possible: it currently fills an area with a semi-transparent blue background. As the app evolves, this method can be expanded to draw smooth lines, curves, or complex shapes representing the stroke.

For a simpler perspective, consider this basic example that connects points with lines:

```rust
fn draw_stroke(points: &[(f32, f32)]) {
    // Imagine this function draws lines between consecutive points
    for window in points.windows(2) {
        let (x1, y1) = window[0];
        let (x2, y2) = window[1];
        println!("Draw line from ({}, {}) to ({}, {})", x1, y1, x2, y2);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stroke = vec![(10.0, 20.0), (15.0, 25.0), (20.0, 30.0)];
    draw_stroke(&stroke);
}
```

In our real code, a similar concept applies. The Renderer calls its `render` method each frame and draws onto a rectangular region allocated by the UI. As you learn more about Rust and GPU programming, you'll understand how the painter abstracts the low-level drawing commands and fuses them into the immediate mode framework.

---

## 4. The Full Pipeline in Action

Let's recap the complete flow:

- **Startup:** The application initializes, setting up the Renderer with a GPU context, so it's ready to handle graphics.
- **Event Processing:** During each frame, the update loop listens for mouse drags and other inputs, capturing stroke data as the user interacts with the canvas.
- **Stroke Processing:** The captured stroke data is stored temporarily. Even though our current implementation demonstrates a basic draw call, the data could be processed further for smoothing or other effects.
- **Rendering:** The Renderer's `render` method is invoked each frame, using the painter to fill the drawing area and eventually render the stroke. UI elements (like buttons and modals) are overlayed to provide interaction and feedback.

This linear progression—from startup to stroke finalization—illustrates the power of immediate mode GUIs: every frame is a fresh slate, making real-time graphics both responsive and simple to implement.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we have dissected the application pipeline. We started by explaining how the app initializes and sets up rendering, moved through capturing user input to create a stroke, and finally saw how that stroke is processed and rendered to the screen.

**What did we learn?**

- **Initialization:** How vital it is to correctly set up your environment (both for GPU resources and app state) at startup.
- **Event Processing:** How immediate mode GUIs reconstruct the UI every frame and capture events like mouse drags.
- **Rendering Pipeline:** How a Renderer can simplify drawing by abstracting away the low-level details into an easy-to-use interface.
- **Rust Fundamentals:** Through simple examples, we reinforced core Rust concepts like functions, ownership, and safe handling of non-serializable resources.

By understanding each step—from startup to the final rendered stroke—you now have a clear picture of how our paint application operates. As you continue learning, remember that every frame is an opportunity to refine and iterate, harnessing the full potential of Rust and modern graphics programming.
