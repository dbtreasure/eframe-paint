# Maintenance Checklist

This document provides a checklist for maintaining the tool state management system.

## Weekly Maintenance

- [ ] **Validate all state transitions**

  - Run the test suite with `cargo test tools::tests`
  - Verify that all transitions work as expected
  - Check for any new transition errors in logs

- [ ] **Memory safety audit**

  - Run tests with MIRI: `cargo +nightly miri test tools::tests`
  - Check for any undefined behavior or memory safety issues
  - Verify that Arc usage is correct and no reference cycles exist

- [ ] **Performance benchmark comparisons**

  - Run benchmarks: `cargo bench tool_transitions`
  - Compare results with baseline measurements
  - Investigate any significant performance regressions

- [ ] **Transition error rate monitoring**
  - Review application logs for transition errors
  - Calculate error rate: `errors / total_transitions`
  - Investigate if error rate exceeds 0.1%

## Monthly Maintenance

- [ ] **Code review of state transitions**

  - Review all `can_transition` implementations
  - Verify that transition validation is consistent
  - Check for any missing state combinations

- [ ] **Tool pool efficiency analysis**

  - Measure tool pool hit rate: `hits / (hits + misses)`
  - Optimize if hit rate falls below 90%
  - Check for any tools not being returned to the pool

- [ ] **State retention audit**

  - Verify that retained states are cleaned up properly
  - Check for any memory leaks related to retained states
  - Ensure `restore_state` implementations are complete

- [ ] **Documentation update**
  - Update state transition diagrams if needed
  - Ensure documentation matches implementation
  - Add examples for any new transitions

## Quarterly Maintenance

- [ ] **Comprehensive test coverage review**

  - Run coverage analysis: `cargo tarpaulin --out Html`
  - Ensure >95% coverage for state transition code
  - Add tests for any uncovered edge cases

- [ ] **API consistency check**

  - Verify that all tools follow the same patterns
  - Check for any inconsistencies in method naming
  - Ensure error handling is consistent across tools

- [ ] **Performance optimization**

  - Profile tool transitions with `perf record`
  - Identify and optimize hot spots
  - Reduce allocations where possible

- [ ] **User experience evaluation**
  - Gather feedback on tool transitions
  - Identify any confusing or unexpected behavior
  - Improve error messages and user guidance

## Adding New Tools

When adding a new tool to the system, complete the following checklist:

- [ ] **Define tool states**

  - Create state structs for each possible state
  - Implement transitions between states
  - Add state to `ToolType` enum

- [ ] **Implement Tool trait**

  - Implement `Tool` trait for each state
  - Ensure consistent behavior with existing tools
  - Add appropriate documentation

- [ ] **Add to ToolPool**

  - Add storage in `ToolPool` struct
  - Update `get` and `return_tool` methods
  - Implement state retention

- [ ] **Update transition validation**

  - Update `validate_transition` method
  - Add transition rules to documentation
  - Create tests for all transitions

- [ ] **Test thoroughly**
  - Create unit tests for all states and transitions
  - Test integration with `EditorState`
  - Verify performance characteristics

## Emergency Response

If critical issues are detected, follow this procedure:

1. **Identify the issue**

   - Determine which tool or transition is causing the problem
   - Collect logs and reproduction steps
   - Assess severity and impact

2. **Implement temporary fix**

   - Add validation to prevent problematic transitions
   - Implement fallback behavior if needed
   - Deploy hotfix if necessary

3. **Root cause analysis**

   - Investigate underlying cause
   - Review related code and transitions
   - Identify any design flaws

4. **Permanent solution**

   - Implement proper fix based on root cause
   - Add tests to prevent regression
   - Update documentation

5. **Post-mortem**
   - Document the issue and solution
   - Share learnings with the team
   - Update maintenance procedures if needed

## Version Control

- [ ] **Tag stable versions**

  - Create git tags for stable versions
  - Include version in application metadata
  - Document changes in release notes

- [ ] **Branch management**

  - Use feature branches for new tools
  - Create release branches for major versions
  - Merge bug fixes to all supported branches

- [ ] **Commit messages**
  - Include tool and state names in commit messages
  - Reference issue numbers when applicable
  - Describe transition changes clearly

## Documentation

- [ ] **Keep diagrams updated**

  - Update state transition diagrams when adding states
  - Ensure diagrams match code implementation
  - Use tools like Mermaid for maintainable diagrams

- [ ] **Code examples**

  - Provide examples for common transitions
  - Update examples when API changes
  - Ensure examples compile with current code

- [ ] **Error documentation**
  - Document all possible transition errors
  - Provide troubleshooting guidance
  - Include recovery strategies

## Performance Monitoring

- [ ] **Allocation tracking**

  - Monitor allocations during transitions
  - Set budget for allocations per transition
  - Alert if allocations exceed budget

- [ ] **Version change monitoring**

  - Track version changes per operation
  - Ensure appropriate version increments
  - Alert on excessive version changes

- [ ] **Memory usage**
  - Monitor retained states count
  - Set limit for maximum retained states
  - Implement cleanup for old retained states
