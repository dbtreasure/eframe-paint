# Cursor Rule: Writing Development History Chapters

This rule provides guidelines for crafting development history chapter write-ups that document key milestones in the evolution of our application. Adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistency, clarity, and a coherent narrative that bridges technical details with high-level insights.

## Structure and Format

- Each chapter should begin with a header indicating the chapter number and a descriptive title (e.g. "# Chapter 3: The Dawn of Painting â€“ Integrating Graphics and Immediate Mode UI").
- Open the chapter with an introduction that sets the context, including relevant commit references or feature introductions.
- Use section headers (such as "Introduction," "Implementation Details," "Code Samples," and "Conclusion") to organize the content logically.
- Include code snippets and examples where relevant, formatted in fenced code blocks, to illustrate concepts and changes.
- Conclude each chapter with a summary that highlights the contributions made and suggests areas for future work.

## Content Guidelines

- Explain the purpose and impact of each chapter, detailing the challenges, design decisions, and outcomes.
- Reference specific commits or technical changes to enhance traceability and context.
- Blend technical depth with accessible language so that both experienced developers and newcomers can follow the narrative.
- Include details about configuration changes, code refactoring, integration of new features (like real-time collaboration, adaptive rendering, or advanced input handling), and improvements in user experience.
- Emphasize continuity by linking the chapter's content with previous milestones and anticipation for future enhancements.

## Tone and Style

- Use an informative, forward-looking, and engaging tone that invites exploration and understanding.
- Maintain a professional voice that is helpful to both seasoned engineers and novices.
- Ensure consistency in formatting, terminology, and structure across all chapters.

## Future Work Section

- Reserve space to allude to potential future improvements, such as additional features, performance enhancements, or integration of new technologies.
- Encourage innovation by suggesting how further development can build on the current achievements.

Adhering to these rules will ensure that each development history chapter is a cohesive, detailed, and instructive record of our project's progression.
