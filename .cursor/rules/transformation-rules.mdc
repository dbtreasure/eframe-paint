# Transformation Rules

## Choose Appropriate Reference Points
- Always consider the user's mental model when selecting transformation reference points
- Don't default to center-based transformations without justification
- Document why a particular reference point was chosen

## Preserve Transform Information
- Never discard transformation information in intermediate steps
- Avoid creating axis-aligned bounding boxes for transformed shapes
- Maintain complete transform state throughout the pipeline

## Use Direct Vector Math
- Prefer vector math over manual sign adjustments
- Let geometric relationships handle directions naturally
- Avoid magic numbers or hard-coded signs

## Handle Coordinate Systems Carefully
- Document which coordinate system is being used (screen space, world space, etc.)
- Be explicit about coordinate system transformations
- Validate coordinate system assumptions with visual debugging
