# Rendering Rules

## Understand the Rendering Pipeline
- Know how egui handles different primitive types
- Document rendering pipeline assumptions
- Be aware of limitations in high-level rendering APIs

## Use Appropriate Primitives
- Choose the lowest-level primitive that preserves all necessary information
- Prefer mesh-based rendering for transformed shapes
- Document why a particular rendering approach was chosen

## Handle Textures Correctly
- Maintain proper UV coordinate mapping
- Consider texture filtering and wrapping modes
- Test texture rendering at different scales and rotations

## Optimize Rendering Performance
- Minimize allocations in render paths
- Cache frequently used calculations
- Profile rendering performance regularly
