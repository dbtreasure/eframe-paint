# Code Organization Rules

## Separation of Concerns
- Separate transform calculation from application
- Separate geometric operations from rendering
- Keep coordinate system transformations isolated

## Clean Abstractions
- Create proper abstractions for transformed shapes
- Provide clear interfaces for transform operations
- Maintain single responsibility principle

## Documentation
- Document coordinate systems and spaces
- Explain transformation pipelines
- Include visual diagrams for complex operations

## Error Handling
- Validate transform inputs
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages for transform failures

## Performance Considerations
- Document performance-critical paths
- Cache expensive calculations
- Use appropriate data structures for frequent operations
